# Bookbot

Extremely crappy analysis of long .txt files. Written for absolutely no other reason than it being a way for me to (finally) get into writing Rust.

## Usage

- Get a random book and save it to ./books/<name>.txt: `wget -O books/frankenstein.txt https://storage.googleapis.com/qvault-webapp-dynamic-assets/course_assets/frankenstein.txt`
- Run the super-ultra-mega-uber-analysis tool: `cargo run -- books/<name>.txt`
